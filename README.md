    <sumary><h3>🧑‍🔬 Coding Journey</h3></sumary>
    My first encounter with programming was thanks to an elective subject in college, which was introduction to data science, after passing it, I began to study in a self-taught way, according to the future needs that would arise in my career, unfortunately, the pandemic interrupted my studies, I spent a year teaching as a private tutor to support me and my parents until I earned enough to pay tuition at a private technical, where I studied computer science, to finally graduate in August 2023 as Bachelor in computer science.
